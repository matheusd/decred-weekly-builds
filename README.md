# Decred Development Binaries

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matheusd/decred-weekly-builds.svg?branch=v20181122143321)](https://travis-ci.org/matheusd/decred-weekly-builds) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hncgrnv0xuqb6s3c/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/matheusd/decred-weekly-builds/branch/master)


**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

These are binaries for the decred project built from unstable, under development
code. Do not use in production. You will not receive support for them.

**MIGHT NOT ALLOW DOWNGRADE**

Sometimes dcrd/dcrwallet changes include migrations which cannot be downgraded.
Since these builds are made from code that is under development (usually from
the master branch of the respective repos), this means that they may include such
migrations. Therefore after running these builds, you might be unable to go back
to older versions of the software without deleting the blockchain or wallet
files.

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**
